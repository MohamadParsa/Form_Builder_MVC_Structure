---
a preliminary form builder with GoLang to render pages dynamically and with observance of MVC structure.
this project use GoLang Template capabilities, so you should add your new HTML elements in `src/viewmodels/htmlobjects/` with GoLang Template format 
also add the element structure in `src/models/`.
to get page elements you should use a database, at the moment some functions return constance values insted of connecting to database.
